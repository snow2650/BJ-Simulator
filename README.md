# BJ-Simulator
A standard deck has 52 cards, so 8 decks = 416 cards.

Half of that = 208 cards (equivalent to 4 decks).

You can simulate or randomly generate any subset of those 416 cards (without replacement) to represent “half of the shoe.”

*Up to 7 players + dealer

*User can choose their seat

*User can add the cards for other players and dealer

*Each player can hit, stand, double, or split

*Monte Carlo win probability shown for the user only
